 <h1>My Journal as I go through NSS</h1>
    <p>My day has been a little scary but exciting. I am hoping to get better at this! Today is almost done. I will eventually get this! Even though it will be challenging. </p>
    <p>I need to study a lot!</p>

    <p>Today was Day Two. Today was much better than yesterday. I feel like I understand most of what we went over on Day One much better now.</p>
    <p>I'm hopeful that I will start to pick this up a little better now that I'm over that first hump.</p>
