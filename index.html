 <h1>My Journal as I go through NSS</h1>
    <p>Today is Day One. My day has been a little scary but exciting. I am hoping to get better at this! Practice will make perfect. </p>
    <p>I just need to study a lot!</p>

    <p>Today was Day Two. Today was much better than yesterday. I feel like I understand most of what we went over yesterday much better now.</p>
    <p>I'm hopeful that I will start to pick this up a little better now that I'm over that first hump.</p>

    <p>Today was Day Three. It was a rough one; I felt like I didn't understand much at all today. I stayed late and am up late studying. 
        There will probably be more of these late nights in my near future!</p>
